# CellPond
CellPond is a slightly-surreal 'cellular automata' engine that I made for fun.

I've made three videos about it! Check them out:<br>
ü¶† [**Cells in Cells in Cells**](https://youtu.be/gv40Z9tVjAI)<br>
ü§ñ [**Nothing**](https://youtu.be/sQYUQNozljo)<br>
üîÆ [**Spellular Automata**](https://youtu.be/xvlsJ3FqNYU)

## What's the big idea?
CellPond has 2 big ideas:<br>
üê∏ You can code it by dragging + dropping shapes.<br>
üê∏ Cells can split/merge cells into smaller/bigger cells.

## How can I use it?
You can try it out at [cellpond.cool](https://cellpond.cool)<br>
(sorry no touch controls yet)

Or, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and open `index.html` in a browser.

## How does it work? What do all the shapes do?
It's a secret.

## Where's the diamond gone?

There used to be a diamond shape! It let you add/subtract/swap channels. But I rewrote a lot of stuff for the [Spellular Automata](https://youtu.be/xvlsJ3FqNYU) video and it broke.

To add/subtract, use the new Hexagon shape instead. You can't swap yet but it's [planned](https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond/issues/281).

## I've ran out of space for paddles!

Don't panic!

Just scroll the mouse wheel while holding down ctrl/cmd/alt/option.

## How do you lock paddles?

Due to recent advances in technology, you don't need to lock paddles to activate them anymore. Now, your paddles are **always active**.

Be careful not to lose your squares though!
